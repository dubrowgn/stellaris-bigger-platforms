Stop clicking so much to maintain mid-to-late game starbases! This mod adds 2x and 4x larger defense platforms, unlocked via their own technologies. They are intended to be a linear scaling of the vanilla Defense Ptation so as to avoid introducing balance issues. These new platforms use the existing (but unavailable) Defense Station and Defense Fortress units that ship with the game.

This mod is based on breloom1994's Defense Fortress mod, but rebalanced to fall in line with the vanilla defense platform to avoid starbases becoming over powered. No additional defense platform slots are added, for example.
